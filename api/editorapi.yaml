  title: Verona Interfaces Specification "Editor"
  version: '4.2.0'
  description: This is one part of the Verona Online Assessment Standards.
    All messages are sent via the postMessage function of the html page. The editor takes the page root of its parent
    as target (parent.window), and the application binds the function call to the iframe element of the editor.

    Most important, the message body carries as first parameter the operationId of the message.

    The html page MUST contain a <script>-tag with metadata. The syntax and structure of this data are described
    [here](https://github.com/verona-interfaces/metadata/#readme).

    SessionIdString:
      description: The session id flags all communication. If a message has no or empty session id, it's not processed. The session id is unique and was generated by the application. Any simple algorithm would work. The session id helps to link the correct unit with the data of the message. Using the id of the editor hosting html element is less reliable, because the element could be reused with another unit.

          description: After starting the editor and loading the unit definition, it might be necessary to load additional code or data from the server. This data is identified by an resource ID (usually a file name). The editor can download this resource by itself without further interaction with the host frontend. The property directDownloadUrl provides the url for download. The editor extends this url by an url separator "/" and the resource ID (uri-encoded if needed).
