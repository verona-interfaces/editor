  title: Verona Inferfaces Specification "Editor"
  version: '2.0.0'
  description: This is one part of the Verona Online Assessment Standards.
    All messages are sent via the postMessage function of the html page. The editor takes the page root of its parent
    as target (parent.window), and the application binds the function call to the iframe element of the editor.

    Most important, the message body carries as first parameter the operationId of the message.

        data of the message. Using the id of the editor hosting html element is less reliable, because the
        element could be reused with another unit.
